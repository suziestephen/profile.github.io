## Motivation
I wanted the portfolio to be fun, fresh and minimalistic. I kept the colour palette clean and picked the two projects I was most proud of to display.

Submit an updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments. <br>
Submit an updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments. <Br>
